"@just-web/types": major

Add `@just-web/types` for defining plugin modules.

It contains `definePlugin()` and `PluginModule` type,
as well as other functions and types to help writing plugins.

Currently, `JustWebApp` and `JustWebTestApp` still resides within `@just-web/app`.

We may move them here in the future.
