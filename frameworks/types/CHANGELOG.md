# @just-web/types

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8c3183e: Add `@just-web/types` for defining plugin modules.

  It contains `definePlugin()` and `PluginModule` type,
  as well as other functions and types to help writing plugins.

  Currently, `JustWebApp` and `JustWebTestApp` still resides within `@just-web/app`.

  We may move them here in the future.
