# Why just-web

- High-level policies are stable and can be reused
- Most applications have similar requirements
- Cut down 80% of the boilerplates

Isn't `@just-web` just like any other frameworks?

Not really. `@just-web` follows the best architecture principles.
Meaning it defers as much decisions as possible.

It gives you the freedom to choose any technology stack you want to use.
You can use `React`, `SolidJS`, `Svelte`, `Angular`, `Mobx`, `Redux`, `axios`, etc.
